if some thing is private in a class then for making it accessable out
side of the class we use getter and setter method

for creating getter use "get key word"

class Account extends Department{

private lastReport: string;
  
get mostRecentReport() {
    if (this.lastReport) {
    return this.lastReport;
    }
    throw new Error('No report found.');
}
}

const accounting = new Account()
accounting.mostRecentReport//error because no report is added

//after adding report ="hello morning"
accounting.mostRecentReport//Something went wrong...
